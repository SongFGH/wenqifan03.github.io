## Brief Biography

Wenqi FAN is a second-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at [City University of Hong Kong(CityU)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). His supervisor is Prof.[Jianping Wang](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jianwang/) and Prof.[Qing LI](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/). Before joining CityU, he completed his MS at SYSU and BS at GDMU.

Currently, he is a visiting student of [Data Science and Engineering(DSE) Lab](http://dse.cse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University, under the supervision of Dr.[Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html).

His current research interests include data mining and machine learning, especially (1) Deep Learning for Social Recommendation; (2) Adversarial Learning and its application in Recommendations
